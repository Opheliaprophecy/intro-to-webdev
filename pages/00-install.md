# Install

To learn web development you'll need to install some basic tools. All of the tools used in this course are Open Source and free.

## Home Brew (Mac / OSX Only)

Home brew is a package manager for OSX that will allow you to easily install the dependencies for this course via the command line.

Install it by going to [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) and following the instructions there.

## Git

Git is a version management tool that you'll use to download instructions and submit assignments. Git is the industry standard tool used by coders for collaboration.

```
# Ubuntu / Devian
apt install git

# Centos / Red Hat
yum install git

# OSX
brew install git
```

For windows download git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download), and run the installer.


## ZSH / Oh My ZSH (optional)

Oh My ZSH is an enhanced shell that provides a lot of nice features for OSX and Linux. It is not required, but will make your experience a little nicer.

To install ZSH and Oh My ZSH simply folow the [Official Installation Guide](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).


## Code editor

The first thing you'll need is some sort of a code editor.

The preferred code editor for this course is [VS Code (Visual Studio Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Some other popular editors that are worth knowing about:

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows Only)


## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript code from the command line. It is used for creating web servers, mobile apps, desktop apps, command line utilities. Installing node.js will give you access to the `node` and `npm` commands in your shell.

To install simply go to [Node JS Homepage](https://nodejs.org) and download the installer. I recommend using the **LTS version**.
